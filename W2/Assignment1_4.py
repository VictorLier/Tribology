# Consider two parallel discs that rotate relative to each other (one steady and one
# rotating) using the aforementioned (see Lecture 1 problems) diameter of 250 mm and
# speed of 1000 rpm. Here some basic investigations regarding friction torque and power
# are conducted.
# We may assume that the discs have a hole i.e. inner radius being variable ri ∈ [0; ro] while
# outer radius ro = 250 mm/2 = 125 mm

# Derive an expression by the integration of the shear stress τ on the bearing surface
# that relates the torque to the key parameters such as viscosity η, speed ω, thickness
# h and radii. (HINT: You may consider an infinitesimal element that is integrated
# over the circular surface between the discs).
