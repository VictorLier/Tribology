# For a journal type bearing, what is the approximate maximum load that can 
# be supported if the shaft is Ã˜125mm and the desired speed range is 1000 rpm. 
# What types of bearings are applicable and what are their maximum loads?

# Variables
dia = 0.125 # [m]
rpm = 1000 # [rpm]

# By studying Figure 2.3, the maximum loads can be determined:
# Rubbing bearings: 200N
# Oil-impregnated porous metal bearings: 4000N
#These two are apparently not applicable

# Rolling-element bearings: 5000N
# Hydrodynamic oli film bearings: 200000N
